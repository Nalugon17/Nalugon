        for once in his life and manages to pull one of them out of harm's way
        before dying. Awakening in a baby's body, he realizes his being

        enhanced strength and regenerative abilities - a regular ghoul produces
        4–7 times more kinetic energy in their muscles than a normal human; they
        also have several times the RC cells, a cell that flows like blood and
        can become solid instantly
